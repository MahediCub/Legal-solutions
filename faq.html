                            Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making
                            it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables,
                            grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows. The CSS Flexbox offers a
                            one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items
                            in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen

                            Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create
                            different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to
                            detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether
                            the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.

                            In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
                            The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists
                            of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the
                            box model.A box in CSS consists of a content area, which is where any text, images, or
                            other HTML elements are displayed. This is optionally surrounded by padding, a border,
                            and a margin, on one or more sides. The box model describes how these elements work
                            together to create a box as displayed by CSS

                            HTML was originally created as a markup language to describe documents on the early
                            internet. As the internet grew and was adopted by more people, its needs changed. Where
                            the internet was originally intended for sharing scientific documents, now people wanted
                            to share other things as well. Very quickly, people started wanting to make the web look
                            nicer.
